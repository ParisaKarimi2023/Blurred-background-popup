# Blurred Background Popup
The Blurred Background Popup Project is a modern web user interface (UI) feature designed to enhance user experience by displaying a popup window while applying a blur effect to the background content. 
This visual technique helps users focus on the popup content without navigating away from the current page.
The project demonstrates the effective use of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to implement contemporary UI/UX design principles.
